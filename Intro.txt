Types of primitive type casting:	
	

1.Widning:  smaller to Bigger is narrowing, done in impcilit way and explicit way both.

    byte    short   int   long  float   double  char  boolean..

2.Narrowing: Bigger to smaller is narrowing, done in explicit way only.

logic:	
What u want to convert to kept in R.H.S ->in which u want to convert that should be on L.H.S
